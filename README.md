# World Happiness Index Dashboard

This project explores the **World Happiness Index**, which ranks countries based on various factors that contribute to overall well-being. The dashboard, built in Tableau, provides an interactive visualization of the latest rankings, factors, and insights into global happiness trends.

## Overview
The World Happiness Index is calculated using survey responses and six critical factors:
- **GDP per capita**: Reflects economic prosperity.
- **Social support**: Measures the strength of social networks.
- **Healthy life expectancy**: Indicates average healthy years of life.
- **Freedom to make life choices**: Highlights personal autonomy.
- **Generosity**: Based on charitable acts and kindness.
- **Perceptions of corruption**: Captures trust in government and institutions.

The final happiness score combines these factors to provide a comprehensive view of happiness across nations.
